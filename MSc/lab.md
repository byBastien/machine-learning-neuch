# Lab Description

In this course lab, we will implement algorithms and methods introduced during our class sessions. The primary goal of this lab is to provide you with hands-on experience and practical insights into machine learning and data science.

The lab will be conducted in the form of tutorials or hands-on assignments. For the hands-on assignments, students are expected to start working on tasks using their own laptops while receiving guidance from the teaching staff.

## Preliminaries
We assume that students have a basic understanding of Python and some useful libraries. For a refresher, we highly encourage students to review the Python introductory chapter ("2.3 Lab: Introduction to Python") from the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* [here](https://www.statlearning.com/).
Some basic Python libraries for data handling and visualization include:

1. **Data handling:**
    - `numpy`: A fundamental Python package for numerical operations, providing support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. You can explore the [API documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html).
        - [User guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html)
    - `pandas`: A versatile Python package for data manipulation and analysis, particularly suited for working with structured data in tabular form. For detailed information, check the [API documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html).
        - [User guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)

2. **Plotting libraries:**
    - `matplotlib`: A highly customizable Python package for creating static, animated, and interactive plots, making it an essential tool for data visualization. Refer to the [API documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) for more information.
        - [User guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html)
    - `seaborn`: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn offers a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. Explore the [API documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) for advanced usage, or check out its [gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) for pre-built examples.

## Setup-Working Environment
You can work in an environment of your choiceâ€”whether it's your personal computer, a cloud service, using Python scripts, or a Jupyter notebook.

While we recommend working on your personal computer for the best experience, you can also use [noto](https://www.epfl.ch/education/educational-initiatives/jupyter-notebooks-for-education/one-click-access-to-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-noto/), a cloud-based Jupyter Server provided by the university with pre-installed libraries, requiring no additional setup. Log in to [noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) using your university credentials.

Please note that using Noto requires a stable internet connection and may sometimes be slower depending on server traffic.

## What You Will Learn
The course focuses on helping students gain a solid understanding of machine learning so they can implement algorithms and work with popular machine learning libraries.

### **Machine Learning Libraries:**
- `Scikit-learn` (`sklearn`): A comprehensive Python library for machine learning, featuring a wide array of algorithms and tools for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. Check the [API documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) for more information.
    - [User guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
- `pytorch`: An open-source deep learning framework that provides a flexible platform for building and training neural networks. Refer to the [API documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) for advanced usage.
    - [User guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html)

These packages will form the foundation for your exploration of machine learning and data science concepts throughout this course.
